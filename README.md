# Meseport

### A mod for [Minetest](http://www.minetest.net)

This mod allows you to teleport by means of Mese and Gold structures.
You punch a gold block that's next to Mese to teleport 100 meters in the
direction that the Mese is located relative to the gold block. Each
additional Mese added in a straight line adds an additional 100 meters.
You can also add Mese to multiple sides in such a way to go in diagonal
directions! However, Mese on opposing sides cancel each other. Thanks to
oscar14 for the Gold-Mese-Transport idea!
